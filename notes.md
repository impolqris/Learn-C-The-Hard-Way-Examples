int = Stores a regular integer, defaulting to 32 bits in size.
double = Holds a large floating-point number.
float = Holds a smaller floating-point number.
char = Holds a single 1-byte character.
void = Indicates "no type" and is used to say that a function returns nothing, or a pointer has no type, as in "void *thing".
enum = Enumerated types, which work as and convert to integers, but give you symbolic names for sets. Some compilers will warn you when you don't cover all elements of an enum in switch-statements.
unsigned = Changes the type so that it doesn't have negative numbers, giving you a larger upper bound but nothing lower than 0.
signed = Gives you negative and positive numbers, but halves your upper bound in exchange for the same lower bound negative.
long = Uses a larger storage for the type so that it can hold bigger numbers, usually doubling the current size.
short = Uses smaller storage for the type so it stores less, but takes half the space.
const = Indicates that the variable won';t change after being initialized.
volatile = Indicates that all bets are off, and the compiler should leave this alone and try not to do any fancy optimizxations to it. You usually only need this if you're doing really weird stuff to your variables.
register = Forces the compiler to keep this variable in a register, and the compiler can just ignore you. These days compilers are better at figuring out where to put variables, so only use this if you can actually measure an improvement in speed.
